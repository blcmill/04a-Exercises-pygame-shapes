Here are some exercises to help you learn about PyGame, the engine we will be using throughout the rest of the semester.

If you are using PyCharm, here is a video that shows you [how to install PyGame](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwY4dzvbBwE) through that IDE. If you want to install it without using PyCharm, there are instructions on the PyGame [Getting Started Wiki](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted).

There are four exercise files in this repository. Follow the instructions in each of them to fulfill the exercise. Then commit your changes to your repository and push them back to GitHub.

Comments in Python are marked by a # sign (for single-line comments) or three matching quotation marks (''' or """) if a comment requires more than one line.

Some of the exercises require you to interpret what is going on. Feel free to explore other variations until you can come up with a reasonable explanation. 

As with your assignments, please edit the LICENSE file (replace the [year] [fullname] with the current year and your name), and edit this file to describe what your code does.
